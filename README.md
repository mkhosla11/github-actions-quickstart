# github-actions-quickstart

Feedback text:
"It does a great job guiding users through the GitHub interface and showing how workflows run on code pushes. However, it lacks deeper explanations of key concepts like workflows, jobs, and runners, and could benefit from tips on debugging or next steps. Adding this could be helpful for beginners like myself."
